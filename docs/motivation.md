# Motivation

In the modern world of development, there are a great many libraries that are used by many developers. But most of them, in the race for functionality, lose flexibility.

For example, it doesn't matter if you are using redux-saga or redux-thunk, or if you have written your solution for dealing with side effects. This should not be related to the library for working with forms.

The library follows the idea: "No abstraction is better than the wrong abstraction".
